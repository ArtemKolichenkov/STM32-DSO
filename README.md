# Digital storage oscilloscope using STM32
NOTE! Work in progress, the code has a lot of bugs and should not be used in production.

This project is based on STM32F429ZI microcontroller. Desktop client is written in Python, PCB layout is done in KiCad.
Code will be updated gradually and I will notify when the stable version is released.
